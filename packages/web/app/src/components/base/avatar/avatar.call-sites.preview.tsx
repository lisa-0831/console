 * Every Avatar in the app, transcribed with its real markup so a change to the component can be
 * judged against what ships.
 *
 * History: all four were `v2/avatar` (Radix) until round 4. Every site passed `shape="circle"` and
 * none passed `src`, so what shipped was a 20px accent dot with a person icon; base draws initials
 * from `alt` instead and is always a circle.
